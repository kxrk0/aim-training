## Project Overview

AIM TRAINER PRO is a professional-grade FPS aim training application designed to help gamers improve their aiming skills, reflexes, accuracy, and reaction times. Originally conceived as a web-based tool, it has evolved into a hybrid web/desktop application with advanced multiplayer features, AI-driven adaptations, and cross-platform support.

### Key Goals
- Deliver realistic, high-fidelity FPS training simulations
- Support diverse training modes from solo practice to competitive tournaments
- Incorporate AI for personalized, adaptive training experiences
- Ensure seamless cross-platform functionality (web, Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Maintain exceptional performance metrics (e.g., 144+ FPS, sub-millisecond latency)
- Foster a community through social and competitive features

### Current Status (as of January 2025)
- Version: Beta 1.4
- Platforms: Web (browser-based), Desktop (Electron for Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Public Access: Temporary via localtunnel; VPS migration planned
- Development Stage: Production-ready beta with core features implemented
- Git Status: On branch 'main', up to date with origin/main; several uncommitted changes and untracked files (see git_status for details)
- Build Status: Desktop app build successful, with unpacked executable available

## Project History and Evolution

The project has progressed through several phases, as documented in README.md and other .md files:

### Timeline
- **Foundation Phase**: Initial web-based FPS trainer with core modes (Precision, Speed, Tracking, Flick)
- **Authentication Phase**: Added user registration, login, and profile management
- **Multiplayer Phase**: Implemented party system and 1v1 competitions
- **Tournament Phase**: Added tournament browser, creation, and management
- **Desktop Conversion**: Wrapped in Electron for native desktop experience (see ELECTRON-SETUP.md)
- **AI Enhancements**: Integrated dynamic difficulty and prediction training
- **Social Features**: Added spectator mode, team challenges, achievements
- **Current Beta 1.4**: Full tournament system, divisions, seasons; ready for public launch
- **Future**: AI analytics, mobile apps, VR support (see Future Roadmap)

Key milestones include successful desktop builds (ELECTRON-BUILD-RESULTS.md) and planned VPS migration (VPS-MIGRATION-PLAN.md).

## Architecture

AIM TRAINER PRO employs a monorepo architecture with clear separation of concerns between client, server, shared utilities, and desktop layers. This facilitates code reuse while maintaining modularity.

### High-Level Architecture Diagram (Conceptual)
```
[User] <-> [Desktop Electron Wrapper] <-> [React Frontend (Client)]
                          |
                          v
[Socket.io] <-> [Node.js Backend (Server)] <-> [Prisma ORM] <-> [PostgreSQL DB]
                          |                                      ^
                          v                                      |
                     [Redis Cache] <-> [Real-time Sessions]
```

- **Frontend**: Handles UI rendering, 3D simulations, and user interactions
- **Backend**: Manages business logic, authentication, and real-time communications
- **Database Layer**: Persistent storage with caching for performance
- **Desktop Layer**: Provides native OS integration for enhanced user experience

### Directory Structure (Detailed)
Based on project_layout and list_dir:
- **assets/**: Icons (icns, ico, png, svg) for desktop branding
- **client/**: React application
  - index.html, package.json, src/ (App.tsx, components/, hooks/, pages/, services/, stores/, utils/)
- **dist-electron/**: Build outputs (win-unpacked/ with exe, dlls, resources/)
- **docs/**: Documentation files (this file, CONTEXT-ENGINEERING.md, etc.)
- **electron/**: Electron-specific files (main.js, package.json, preload.js, renderer.js)
- **scripts/**: Utility scripts (build-icons.js, create-simple-icon.js, etc.)
- **server/**: Node.js backend
  - package.json, prisma/ (schema.prisma), src/ (config/, controllers/, middleware/, routes/, services/, sockets/, utils/)
- **shared/**: types/ and utils/ for cross-component sharing
- Other files: docker-compose.yml, redis.conf, various .md files, package.json (root)

Untracked files and changes indicate active development (e.g., new components in client/src/).

### Data Flow Examples
- **Solo Training**: User input â†’ Three.js rendering â†’ Local analytics â†’ Server sync for stats

## Performance Considerations

### Targets
- FPS: Consistent 144+ with Three.js optimizations
- Input Latency: <1ms mouse-to-render
- Load Time: <2s initial
- Network: <50ms for multiplayer sync

### Optimizations
- Object pooling in Three.js for targets
- Efficient Socket.io event handling
- Code splitting in Vite
- Memoization in React components
- Redis caching for frequent queries

### Monitoring
- Built-in: Real-time HUD with FPS/stats
- Tools: Chrome DevTools, Electron performance API
- Production: PM2 monitoring, server logs

## Security and Best Practices

### Security Features
- Authentication: JWT with bcrypt hashing
- CORS: Restricted to client origins
- Input Validation: Joi in server
- Electron: Context isolation, nodeIntegration false
- HTTPS: Via Certbot in production

### Best Practices
- Code: TypeScript strict mode, ESLint rules
- Commits: Descriptive messages, feature branches
- Testing: Component tests, end-to-end scenarios
- Documentation: Keep README and docs updated

## Testing Strategies

### Types of Tests
- **Unit**: Individual components/functions (e.g., sensitivity calculations)
- **Integration**: API endpoints, Socket.io events
- **E2E**: Full user flows (login â†’ training â†’ multiplayer)
- **Performance**: FPS benchmarks, load testing

### Tools
- Jest/Vitest for unit tests
- Cypress for E2E
- Artillery for load testing
- Manual: Cross-browser/device testing

### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions for automated tests on PRs
- Coverage thresholds: 80%+

## Known Issues and Limitations
